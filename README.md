# The Git Playbook

A professional yet fun guide to using Git commands effectively.

### 🌟 Creating a New Repository on GitHub

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/login) and log in.

2. Click on the + sign in the top right corner and select New repository.

3. Enter a repository name (e.g., The-git-playbook).

4. Choose the repository type (Public or Private).

5. (Optional) Add a README, .gitignore, or license.

6. Click Create repository.

Once created, follow the instructions below to link your local project to GitHub.

### 🆕 Creating a New Repository

Creating a new repository means starting from scratch. You initialize Git in an empty folder and then link it to a new GitHub repository.

_Use Case: When starting a new project that doesn’t have version control yet._

#### Commands:

```bash
# Initialize Git
git init

# Link to the remote repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/The-git-playbook.git

# Add files to staging
git add .

# Commit files with a message
git commit -m "Initial commit"

# Rename the branch to 'main'
git branch -M main

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

<!------------------>

### 🔄 Pushing an Existing Repository

Pushing an existing repository means you already have a local project with Git initialized, and you want to upload it to GitHub.

_Use Case: When you've been working on a project locally and decide to store it on GitHub._

#### Commands:

```bash
# Initialize Git
# Link to the remote repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/The-git-playbook.git

# Rename the branch to 'main'
git branch -M main

# Push the repository to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

<!------------------>

### 📄 Creating a README File

A README file is an important part of a repository, providing an overview of the project.

#### Commands:

```bash
# Create a README file
echo "# The-git-playbook" >> README.md

# Add and commit the file
git add README.md
git commit -m "Added README file"
```

<!------------------>

### 📥 Clone a GitHub Repository

If you want to work on an existing GitHub repository, you need to clone it to your local machine. This will create a local copy of the repository inside a folder named The-git-playbook.

#### Commands:

```bash
# Clone a GitHub repository to your local machine
git clone https://github.com/The-git-playbook.git
```

<!------------------>

### 📂 Adding and Pushing Files to a Cloned Repository

Once you have cloned a repository, you do not need to initialize Git again. You can directly add and push files using the following steps:

#### Commands:

```bash
# Navigate into the cloned repository
cd The-git-playbook

# Check the repository status
git status

# Stage all new and modified files
git add .

# Stage a specific file
git add filename

# Commit the changes
git commit -m "Added new files"

# Push the changes to GitHub
git push origin main
```

<!------------------>

### 🔍 Check the Status of Your Repository

#### Commands:

```bash
# Show the current status of your working directory
git status
```

<!------------------>

### 🛠️ Add and Commit Changes

#### Commands:

```bash
# Stage all modified and new files
git add .

OR

# Stage a specific file
git add filename

# Commit the changes with a message
git commit -m "Updated files"
```

<!------------------>

### 📤 Push Changes to GitHub

#### Commands:

```bash
# Push the committed changes to the remote repository
git push origin main
```

<!------------------>

### 🔄 Pull Latest Changes from GitHub

#### Commands:

```bash
# Fetch and merge changes from the remote repository
git pull origin main
```

<!------------------>

### 🔗 Merging Unrelated Histories

Sometimes, when merging two unrelated repositories or pulling changes from a remote repository that has a different commit history, Git may refuse to merge due to unrelated histories. This can happen when you create a local repository and later try to connect it to an existing GitHub repository.

_Use Case: When you need to merge two repositories that were created separately._

#### Commands:

```bash
git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories
```

This forces Git to merge histories that don’t share a common ancestor.

<!------------------>

### 🏷️ Create a New Branch and Switch to It

#### Commands:

```bash
# Create a new branch
git branch feature-branch

# Switch to the new branch
git checkout feature-branch
```

<!------------------>

### 🔀 Merge Branches

#### Commands:

```bash
# Switch back to the main branch
git checkout main

# Merge changes from another branch
git merge feature-branch
```

<!------------------>

### 🚫 Undo Changes

#### Commands:

```bash
# Unstage a file but keep changes
git reset HEAD <file>

# Discard changes in a file
git checkout -- <file>
```
